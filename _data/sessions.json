        "description": "Do you find yourself sitting in an office chair for hours on end, hunching into that awful turtle posture? It’s time to break out of your shell, get out of your chair more often, and adopt a more active office lifestyle. This session will discuss research that explains the downsides to sedentary behavior, cover why improving your everyday office routine is vital, and provide simple tools to do so. An essential element to a new office lifestyle is the habit: we will learn the components of a habit and how to create a new habit or modify an existing one. This session was developed and presented for the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) conference in 2016 which draws over 11,000 female engineers annually.",

        "description": "If you were a carpenter, would your skills at building be more important than the tools you use to build? Skills, right? Tools are just a means to an end. So why do developers think the language they use defines the problems they solve?\n\nThis talk will take a look at misconceptions across the board, some experiences, both positive and negative, people have had crossing barriers to new languages, and show some of the benefits thinking of one's self as a coder and not a \"Ruby coder\" or a \"PHP dev\" can have on being a better problem solver.",

        "description": "Cloud services allow for easier multi-regional deployments for scalability and fail-over, however managing the data is largely left up to the application developers. In this talk, we will look at the benefits and problems that come with systems that require state and several architectures to work towards active-active systems across data centers or regions. We will wrap up with a look at CRDTs, what problems they are fit for and how they address certain distributed data problems.",
